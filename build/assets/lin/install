# This script is optional. Really all you need is the cbxv executable, but
# if you use a traditional desktop, and you grabbed a release from Github
# you could run this and it would copy things to the standard places
#
# After you unzipped the release run it like:
# sudo ./install

cp ./cbxv /usr/bin/cbxv
cp ./wtf.swbd.cbxv.desktop /usr/share/applications/cbxv.desktop
cp ./logo_cbxv.png /usr/share/icons/hicolor/1024x1024/apps/logo_cbxv.png
