# cbxv user manual

## tl;dr - Quickstart
Open the archive (.tar.gz, .zip, .dmg), usually by dobule-clicking on it
Locate the executable (cbxv, cbxv.exe, cbxv.app), double-click on it
cbxv will start and you'll see:
[image-00]
Hit the "o" key or click the "Title Button" in the upper-right
The File Open Dialog will display, navigate to a cbx (.cbr, .cbz) file, double-click it
You'll see something like:
[image-01]
In this case we're seeing the cover on the left and the inside cover on the right. 
Hit the "r" key (Join Toggle || Button) and you'll see:
[image-02]
The first page, the cover, has essentially been "Joined" or turned into a single-page
with a span of 2, so that it displays by itself. All of the other pages have also been
adjusted in the layout. Hit the "Right Arrow" key and you'll see:
[image-03]
In this case of a good cover-to-cover scan, you're all set. If the book you're reading
has other pages that are out of place you can join them or hide them as necessary
until the layout is correct. cbxv will remember the layout so the next time you open
the book it will be correct.
Excelsior!

    the releases section.
